# An Exploration Of Continued Fractions of Fibonacci Powers

## Abstract

The famous Fibonacci numbers are defined as $$F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1, F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}.$$ These numbers share a unique connection with continued fractions, and in this paper, we explore one of these connections.
We will be looking at the continued fraction of Fibonacci powers, that is, $b^{F_0}, b^{F_1}, b^{F_2}, \dots, b^{F_n}$. We prove the formula for this continued fraction by decomposing it into 2 continued fractions andproving their formulas.
